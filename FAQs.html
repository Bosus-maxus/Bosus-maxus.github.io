            <h2> Why did we made TerraPuls'R NANO?</h2>
        </section>

        <section class="Answers">
            <p>Because environmental awareness shouldn't require expensive lab equipment.
               We wanted people — including kids, students, parents, outdoor enthusiasts, and professionals — to have clear, reliable information about the world around them, anytime they want it.
               No more guessing “Is the air clean? Is the UV too strong?”  now you'll know and have confidence in your numbers.</p>

            <h2> Who made TerraPuls'R NANO?</h2>
        </section>

        <section class="Answers">
            <p>We are just ordinary students, human beings like you, not a big tech corporation.
               We started this project after realizing that our machine has potential not only as an educational tool for environment awarreness, but as a lifesaver against the slow and silent killers, eating your life year by year.
               However, not many people have access to environmental monitoring tools to even begin with, let alone it being reliable and affordable.
               So we built one. And now we want to share it with everyone.
